  "difficulty": 3,
  "explanation": "Since JavaScript is a weakly-typed language, values can also be converted between different types automatically, and it is called implicit type coercion. The + here is the arithmetic addition operator. If the operands (the left and right of the +) are booleans or numbers, it will coerce to numbers (true becomes 1, false becomes 0). If any of the operands is a string, it will do string concatenation.",
  "correctAnswer": "1 'truefoo' 'bar5'",
